                <p>It’s that time of the year when we get to see bunch of new iPhone’s from Apple. At its California Streaming event yesterday (14 September) Apple announced its four new iPhones for 2021-22.</p>

                    <p>The new handsets are called the iPhone 13, 13 mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.</p>

                <h4>iPhone 13 Design –</h4>
                <div class="img-para">
                    <p>As expected, the new iPhones are externally similar to last year’s models. Apple very rarely makes significant design changes.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="./images/img_1747.webp" class="mid-img">
                <div class="img-para">
                    <p>One external change that is noticeable, however, is the reconfiguration of the twin rear lenses on the iPhone 13 and 13 mini: these are arranged diagonally, rather than vertically as on the iPhone 12.</p>

                <h4>iPhone 13 Display –</h4>
                <div class="img-para">
                    <p>Across all four new iPhones, the front True Depth camera takes up less screen real estate to prioritise the display, and are powered by Apple’s latest A15. This year, Apple is cutting down on the size of the front display notch, which
                        still features all the usual Face ID sensors but is now 20% smaller.</p>

                <div class="img-para">
                    <p>The new display in the base model is branded “Super Retina XDR” and is 28 percent brighter at 800 nits.
                        <br><br> The Pro iPhones are getting a major display upgrade. After years of high refresh rate Android phones, Apple’s Pro devices are finally getting ProMotion displays. That means that they’ll offer a 120Hz refresh rate that
                        should give software smooth animations and a responsive feel. This is a feature that’s long overdue, but it’s still nice to see.</p>

                <div class="img-para">
                    <p>As is tradition, the series is getting an improved processor — all four models now offer Apple’s A15 Bionic chip. The new chip is based on the 5nm process. It’s a 6-core CPU with two high-performance cores and four high-efficiency
                        cores.

                    <p>The storage amounts are being updated too. Apple has done away with the 64GB storage option, meaning that the base iPhone now offers 128GB. And, there’s a new 1TB storage option too.</p>

                <div class="img-para">
                    <p>The iPhone 12 series represented a big step forward for the iPhone’s camera, bringing larger camera sensors that perform better in low light. Like the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini, the two lower-end models still have a dual-camera setup with
                        one 12-megapixel wide and one 12-megapixel ultrawide camera. And, the Pro devices still have a triple camera setup, which adds a 12-megapixel telephoto camera to the mix.</p>

                <div class="img-para">
                    <p>The iPhone 13 Pro devices offer an improved 6-element ultrawide camera with an f/1.8 aperture. This ensures they can perform better in low-light conditions, plus it allows the device to take macro photography without the need for a
                        dedicated macro camera.<br><br> iPhone 13 series offers some new software features too. They have a new Cinematic Mode feature, which is basically Portrait Mode for video. The mode lets you change focus by tapping on subjects on
                        the display.
